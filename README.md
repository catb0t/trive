# trive triangular voxel engine
cubic voxels are so 2010. the voxel-like engine of the future is based in tetrahedrons

---

tetrahedrons are equilateral triangular pyramids, but there's no good acronym names to come from tetra-, so trive it is.

everyone can understand triangles, in fact most polygonal engines render everything by surface triangles.

i love voxel engines, but there are heaps and pounds of open source ones already, to make open world RPG games in.

well, we're going to take a new idea.

written in C++11, but only for namespaces and to use [virtual-addressing](https://github.com/catb0t/virtual-addressing), otherwise it is basically C.
